				<div id="volunteer">
					<div id="vol-row1">
						<p>While working for Sendwithus in Victoria, I was introduced to Ladies Learning Code.
						I mentored women who were transitioning into tech careers to learn HTML & CSS. 
						My favourite experience was teaching the Girls Learning Code workshop for 7-12 year olds.
						The honor of empowering girls to translate their dreams of one day owning a horse ranch or a bakery into a 
						website was unforgettable.</p>

					<div id="vol-row2">
						<p> The Waterloo Food Bank services local programs and families with non-perishable and sustainable foods. I help them
						as an ambassador during events and raise awareness for ending hunger.</p>
